# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This repository covers all the major **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python with **detailed explanations, practical examples, and mini projects** to help learners master OOP from scratch.

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn
- **Classes and Objects** – Learn how to define and create objects in Python.  
- **Constructors & Destructors** – Understand how objects are initialized and cleaned up.  
- **Encapsulation** – Protect your data using private and protected attributes.  
- **Inheritance** – Reuse and extend existing code using parent-child class relationships.  
- **Polymorphism** – Write flexible and dynamic code using method overriding.  
- **Abstraction** – Simplify complex systems by hiding implementation details.  
- **Dunder (Magic) Methods** – Explore special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and more.  
- **Real-world Examples** – Practical coding exercises to strengthen understanding.

### 🏆 "Master OOP once, and the rest of Python will make perfect sense."


Would you like me to also include a **“Mini Project Overview”** section (for example, explaining what your `student_management_system.py` does)? It will make your README look even more professional.
